### The images above show two types of noise patterns: noise point images on the left and noise line images on the right. Together, these noisy images form a dataset specifically designed for training satellite image noise detection and segmentation algorithms.
# The paper is currently under review, and the source code and dataset will be made available upon acceptance.
